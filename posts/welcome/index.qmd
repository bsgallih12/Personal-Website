Hi! Thanks for visiting this blog. The main purpose of this blog will be to serve as an educational resource for all things R with respect to data analysis and visualization. I plan to be able to put out at least one blog post every other week starting with the basics and moving into more advanced topics as we go along. I hope that you will find this blog helpful.
